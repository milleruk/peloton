# Pedaling Further: Findings from the Peloton API

After working out and analyzing the results provided by Peloton, I often wondered what more could be found in my workout data. Peloton provides okay metrics, but I would find myself asking questions like: does the music I like correlate to better performance? At any given second, how did my performance fare compared to the instructor's suggested range? Why can't I overlay the instructors ride details on my charts?
